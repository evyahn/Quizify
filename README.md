# Quizify

Quizify is an application that allows users to make playlists by taking a quiz.
Developed by Evelyn Ahn and Grace Whaley for SI 379 final project.

Evelyn created the script javascript file which interacts with the Spotify API such as fetching profiles, creating playlists, and getting song recommendations.
She also wrote the quiz2 javascript file which manages the quiz functionality.

Grace created the html files and css styling sheets.
She also created the interactions javascript file which created events for the buttons such as get playlist results and moving between pages.
She assisted with the quiz2 functionality and implementation.
